      "value": "<p>This programming language was originally developed by a thrifty university student building their own coffee-serving minibot. This code is primarily used with an operating system that maximizes compatibility by converting all system checks between different proprietary software while routing driver keys to simulated virtual drones, which makes sure parts from different manufacturers (and even other worlds) will work with the same minibot. The increase in sales for individual components and nonprofit status of the freeware have kept minibot companies from attempting to outlaw the software, and some companies have even adopted the controversial practice of anonymously leaking drivers on the infosphere.</p><p><strong>Spell Cache</strong> 1st @UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.spells.Item.R9Znyb9sgD9xZISH]{summon robot}; 2nd @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.f8SBoXiXQjlCKqly]{illusory creature}; 3rd @UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.spells.Item.N4yo1ViE9yKLTHRE]{discharge}; 4th @UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.spells.Item.AuzNHVHvsQPFIOQT]{speak with computers}; 5th @UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.spells.Item.maSNDA5pJDbNLIcc]{control machine}; 6th @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.OsOhx3TGIZ7AhD0P]{dominate}; 7th @UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.spells.Item.U4nNXYDa21GCUiGZ]{wall of steel}; 8th @UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.spells.Item.fw22ONdlaQ93RK9I]{phantasmal fleet}; 9th @UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.spells.Item.FDm63NThHyPBWmNz]{telekinetic tantrum}</p><p><strong>Magic Hack</strong> initial: @UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.spells.Item.mvKioQokdAuI3QAX]{signal relay}; advanced: spell transfer protocol; greater: @UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.spells.Item.HbMb3nF4rYn43iLh]{overclock minion}</p><p><strong>Spellshape</strong> @UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.feats.Item.dTJhe4lXsld5rTo7]{Incognito Spell}</p><p><strong>Overclock Boost</strong> (minion) Whenever you Command an overclocked minion, you can additionally Sustain a spell as a free action.</p><p><strong>Jailbreak Spellshape</strong> When you Jailbreak Spell using the Incognito Spell spellshape, the spell manifests from one of your minions instead of yourself.
