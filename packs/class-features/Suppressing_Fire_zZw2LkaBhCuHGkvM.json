If you make an attack with a weapon that has the area trait (such as from the @UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.actions.Item.oc0ZKnk5zD0GXqZi]{Area Fire} or @UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.actions.Item.6ctkxUnVwqooSvgg]{Auto-Fire} actions), you use it in a manner that suppresses your targets. Enemies in the affected area who fail their save against your attack become @UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.conditions.Item.enA7BxAjBb7ns1iF]{Suppressed} until the start of your next turn. A suppressed target takes a –1 circumstance penalty on attack rolls and takes a –10-foot status penalty to its Speeds. Some Soldier abilities and class feats interact further with the suppressed condition.</p>"
