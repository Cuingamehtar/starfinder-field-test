If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell and the target would be affected, choose one: either that spell only affects the target, or that spell doesn't affect your target.</p><p>If the next action you use has the transfer trait and uses the same target, your vitality network regains up to 4 of those lost Hit Points; if you are master in your connection skill, it regains 6 Hit Points instead; if you are legendary, it regains 8 Hit Points. Your vitality network can never regain more Hit Points than was spent to use the transfer action and can't exceed its maximum capacity.</p>"
