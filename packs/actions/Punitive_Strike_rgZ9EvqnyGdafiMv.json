Ignore the unwieldy trait on your weapon when using this action. Make a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If your attack hits, the target is @UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.conditions.Item.enA7BxAjBb7ns1iF]{Suppressed}, and if the trigger was a move action, you disrupt that action. This Strike doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike.</p>"
