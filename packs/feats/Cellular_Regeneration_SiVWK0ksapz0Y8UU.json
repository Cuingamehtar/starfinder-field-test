      "value": "<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p><hr /><p>Your body can repair damaged cells and even regrow missing limbs. You gain regeneration equal to half your level for 1 minute. During this time, you can't die from damage and your dying condition can't increase to a value that would kill you, though if your @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Yl48xTdMh3aeQYL2]{wounded} value becomes 4 or higher, you stay @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious} until your wounds are treated. Each time you regain Hit Points from regeneration, you also regrow one damaged or ruined organ (if any), and you can reattach severed body parts by spending an Interact action to hold the body part to the area it was severed from.</p>",
