It can attempt a Will saving throw to resist being controlled by you. If the target is already under someone else's command, the controlling creature also rolls a saving throw, and the construct uses the better result.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected and is temporarily immune for 24 hours.</p><p><strong>Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p><p><strong>Failure</strong> The construct or tech creature becomes a minion under your control. The spell gains a duration of 1 minute, but it is dismissed if you or an ally attacks the construct or tech minion.</p><p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the duration is 1 hour. </p><hr /><p><strong>Jailbreak</strong> If you use Jailbreak Spell to use this spellshape, if the construct or tech creature succeeds at its save but doesn't critically succeed, it is your minion for 1 round. If the construct fails its save, it is your minion for 10 minutes. If it critically fails, it is your minion for 24 hours.</p>",
