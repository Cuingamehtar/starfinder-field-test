You Interact to create a simple barrier from surrounding materials, then @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.ust1jJSCZQUhBZIz]{Take Cover} behind this barrier to gain lesser cover (rather than the standard cover usually granted by Taking Cover). This barrier does not otherwise grant lesser cover to anyone. At the end of your next turn, this simple barrier breaks down, becoming ineffective. This barrier has AC 10 and is immediately destroyed when it is dealt any damage.</p><p>If you have the @UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.feats.Item.jSzuRceUiH3yspYD]{Barricade} feat, you instead Barricade, then Take Cover behind your barricade (gaining standard cover, as usual for Taking Cover). This barrier still breaks down at the end of your next turn, but it is much sturdier as your knowledge lets your employ additional construction methods. The barrier has AC 10, Hardness equal to half your level, and Hit Points equal to twice your level.</p>"
