When calculating your travel Speed for the day while Piloting a vehicle, you can attempt a @Check[type:piloting] check to increase your vehicle's travel Speed for long-term overland or aerial travel. The DC is determined by the GM but is typically based on the vehicle's piloting DC or a difficulty based on the environment, whichever is harder. On a success, increase your vehicle's travel Speed by half. This has no effect on your vehicle's movement in encounters.</p><p>This has no effect on starships travelling through the Drift.</p>"
