On a hit, you create an impressive display of solar energy between you and your foe. Creatures attempting to target you through your struck target increase the level of cover you receive by one level: lesser cover becomes standard cover, or standard cover becomes greater cover in the case of larger creatures. This effect lasts until the start of your next turn.</p><p><strong>Graviton-Attuned</strong> Until the start of your next turn, whenever you wouldn't have any cover against an attack, you gain the benefits of lesser cover against that attack.</p><p><strong>Photon-Attuned</strong> If a creature's attack would have cover from the creature you struck, that creature takes a â€“1 circumstance penalty to its attack. This lasts until the start of your next turn.</p>"
